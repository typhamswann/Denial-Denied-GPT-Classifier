In their paper, they used a technique called multiple linear regression to determine the forcing of temperature by several forcing mechanism (natural variability, volcanoes, solar variability, and human greenhouse gas forcing).

"Some politicians in Washington say adding more carbon dioxide to the air is closing the window at the top of the atmosphere and allowing less heat to escape to space. The answer as to whether this is true or not is not going to come from looking at how much the earth has warmed up in the last 150 years. This planet has warmed and cooled so many times in the past that the current temperature trend is just a repeat of what has happened many, many times before. There are simply too many natural temperature cycles caused by too many forces of nature that will mask any underlying forcing mechanism. Thankfully there is a new way to find an answer.

First, I doubt that it would be paid into fairly: based on their unwillingness to adopt binding emission reduction targets, and their demands for wealth transfer from the developed countries to the developing, I very much doubt that the semi-developed countries will agree to contribute, any more than they are likely to agree to binding emission reductions. Second, I am also dubious about government's ability (any government) to keep its hands out of the funds, rather than spending them today, and replacing them with IOUs, as is a common practice in such ""trust funds.""

"This followed on the heels of the September 2013 PNAS paper, in which a University of Texas team looked at emissions from some activities associated with hydraulically fractured wells for the first time. The UT led bottom-up study was the first study released in EDF’s methane research series. Though it found total emissions for the production segment of the natural gas system to be similar to EPA estimates, it also found that emissions from some sources were much higher than EPA estimated – valves, compressors, and pipes located at the well pad, for example, all showed higher than estimated emissions. The study also found that emissions from well completions – at the end of the hydraulic fracturing process – were dramatically lower than EPA estimates where new emission controls were used. This is likely because in 2012, when the measurements were made, drillers were beginning to deploy the reduced emissions completions (REC) equipment required by EPA. RECs will be required for all new natural gas wells beginning in January 2015, but are not required for associated oil-and-gas wells. One clear policy implication was that REC equipment should be required across the board.","This followed on the heels of the September 2013 PNAS paper, in which a University of Texas team looked at emissions from some activities associated with hydraulically fractured wells for the first time.

Here we establish the chronology of high and low latitude climate change at the last glacial termination by 14C dating benthic and planktonic foraminiferal stable isotope and Mg/Ca records from a marine core collected in the western tropical Pacific. Deep sea temperatures warmed by ~2C between 19 and 17 ka B.P. (thousand years before present), leading the rise in atmospheric CO2 and tropical surface ocean warming by ~1000 years. The cause of this deglacial deep water warming does not lie within the tropics, nor can its early onset between 19-17 ka B.P. be attributed to CO2 forcing. Increasing austral spring insolation combined with sea-ice albedo feedbacks appear to be key factors responsible for this warming.","Establishing what caused Earths largest climatic changes in the past requires a precise knowledge of both the forcing and the regional responses.

"Fracking and horizontal drilling have been critically important technologies in the extraction of the vast amount of recoverable oil and gas in various parts of the country and the revitalization of America's energy sector. Drilling and extraction create jobs, but there are often tremendous job opportunities for engineers, geologists, mathematicians, truck drivers, welders, and others as well. There are also increased needs for associated manufacturing as well as demand for repair shops, menders, hardware stores, restaurants, hotels, and laundromats among many others.

Willie Soon in 2009 found a ten year delay from TSI to sea surface temperature changes in the tropical Atlantic. Moffa-Sanchez et al in 2014 found a lag of around 12 years from TSI to North Atlantic surface temperatures over the last thousand years. Usoskin et al in 2004 found that the correlation coefficient between northern hemisphere temperature and reconstructed sunspot numbers from 850AD was greatest when the temperature lagged the sunspot numbers by around 12 years. Greg Goodman finds a peak in the correlation between sea surface temperatures and sunspot numbers when the former lags by 10.1 years (though sunspot numbers would correlate a little like that with white noise).,Willie Soon in 2009 found a ten year delay from TSI to sea surface temperature changes in the tropical Atlantic.

"We have already seen that there is ambiguity in computing the probability of events. The more complex these events the more imprecise the estimate. It is also often the case that part (2) of the risk analysis is the most difficult. The events themselves cannot be articulated, either completely or unambiguously. In simple physical systems they often can be, of course, but in complex ones like the climate or ecosystems they are not.

"Otto et al. (2013) : There are two TCR estimates from this energy budget study included in Figure 10.20a. One estimate uses 20002009 data and has a median of 1.3C, with a 595% range of 0.92.0C. The other estimate uses 19702009 data and has a median of slightly over 1.35C, with a 595% range of 0.72.5C. Since mean forcing was substantially higher over 20002009 than over 19702009, and was also less affected by volcanic activity, the TCR estimate based on 20002009 data is less uncertain, and arguably more reliable, than that based on 19702009 data.","Otto et al.
