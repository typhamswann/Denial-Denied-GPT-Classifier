In brief, the global temperature has remained constant for longer than it has increased. Perhaps this should not be surprising as in the seven decades since 1940 the world has gotten warmer in only two of them, and if one considers each decade individually the increase in temperature in each has barely been statistically significant. Only when the warming in the 1980s is added to that of the first half of the 1990s does the change exceed the noise in the system.","['1.4', '1.7']",['1.4'],2,2

In contrast to EPW events, CPW episodes are associated with a greater-than-average frequency and increasing landfall potential along the Gulf of Mexico coast and Central America.

This CO 2 -induced photosynthetic enhancement slowly declined over the growing season, stabilizing around 15% for the time period between 23 and 60 days after planting. In addition, when measuring photosynthetic rates at reduced oxygen concentrations of 2%, the authors observed 16 and 9% increases in photosynthesis for ambient and CO 2 -enriched plants, respectively, indicating that elevated CO 2 was reducing photorespiratory carbon losses. Even so, this phenomenon could not fully account for the CO 2 -induced stimulation of photosynthesis.

1946,"The new TSCA requirements enacted by Congress in 2016 establish a process under which EPA is both authorized and obligated to protect the public—and it has particular consequences for workers because they are most likely to be exposed to new chemicals. But the Trump EPA instead adopted a chemical-industry crafted fiction: the presumption, despite evidence to the contrary, that workers will be protected from new chemicals because they will always use the personal protective equipment (things like gloves, eye protection, dust masks, respirators etc.) that is recommended in safety data sheets prepared by chemical manufacturers, and that it will always fit and function effectively. As an example of how misguided this is, the respirators recommended for working with methylene chloride will degrade upon exposure to methylene chloride, thus rendering them ineffectual. Rather than impose mandatory requirements on chemical manufacturers to protect workers as Congress intended (including engineering controls that are more effective and reliable than personal protective equipment), or preventing the introduction of new dangerous chemicals, EPA is pretending there is no problem. It’s a move both cynical and deadly.","The new TSCA requirements enacted by Congress in 2016 establish a process under which EPA is both authorized and obligated to protect the public—and it has particular consequences for workers because they are most likely to be exposed to new chemicals.

803,"Although fracking has been used for 60 years, in combination with deep horizontal drilling it has sent U.S. oil and gas production sharply upward for the first time in decades, turned ""imminent depletion"" into another century of affordable petroleum, generated millions of jobs and billions of dollars in government revenues, kept home heating and electricity prices from skyrocketing in the face of EPA's war on coal, brought a resurgence in US petrochemical and other industries, and helped reduce CO2 emissions (which should make Earth Guardians and other global warming true believers happy). It's meant fewer oil imports, improved balance of trade, and more opportunities to lift more people out of poverty worldwide.","Although fracking has been used for 60 years, in combination with deep horizontal drilling it has sent U.S. oil and gas production sharply upward for the first time in decades, turned ""imminent depletion"" into another century of affordable petroleum, generated millions of jobs and billions of dollars in government revenues, kept home heating and electricity prices from skyrocketing in the face of EPA's war on coal, brought a resurgence in US petrochemical and other industries, and helped reduce CO2 emissions (which should make Earth Guardians and other global warming true believers happy).

Hansen conveniently ignored the report's common sense conclusion that this oil will be put to use with or without the pipeline. If CO2 is Hansen's worry, transporting the oil less efficiently would surely emit more.","NASA's James Hansen said in a statement that, ""to say that the tar sands have little climate impact is an absurdity.""

1785,"The process of territorialization of the seas has been twofold: the ""enlarging"" of territorial waters from 12 miles to 200 miles, but also the ""deepening"" of territorialization. Twenty years ago, offshore wells were being drilled in just a few hundred feet of water; with ever-improving technology, prospecting then moved to deep water (i.e. beyond 1,300 feet) and more recently still to ""ultra-deep"" drilling under as much as 10,000 feet, with dramatic consequences for some countries like Brazil, who went from quasi-total dependence on foreign oil to quasi-total independence.","The process of territorialization of the seas has been twofold: the ""enlarging"" of territorial waters from 12 miles to 200 miles, but also the ""deepening"" of territorialization.
